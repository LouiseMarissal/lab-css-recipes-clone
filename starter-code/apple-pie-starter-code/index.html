          This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another
          one<br />
          quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several
          first place<br />
          prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites
          as well!

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <p>
          1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a
          saucepan. Stir in<br />
          flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and
          bring to a boil. Reduce<br />
          temperature and let simmer.<br />
          2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
          slightly. Cover with a<br />
          lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the
          crust. Pour slowly so<br />
          that it does not run off.<br />
          3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to
          350 degrees F (175<br />
          degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are
          soft.
